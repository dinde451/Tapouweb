Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.
<br />The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.
<br /><strong>Faerie Fire</strong>. You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast <em><a href="sorts03c7.html?vo=faerie-fire">faerie fire</a></em> from the ring.
<br /><strong>Ball Lightning</strong>. You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameler spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.
<br />Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.
<br />As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.
<br /><table><tr><th>Spheres</th><th>Lightning Damage</th></tr><tr><td class="center">4</td><td class="center">2d4</td></tr><tr><td class="center">3</td><td class="center">2d6</td></tr><tr><td class="center">2</td><td class="center">5d4</td></tr><tr><td class="center">1</td><td class="center">4d12</td></tr></table>
<br /><strong>Shooting Stars</strong>. You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
