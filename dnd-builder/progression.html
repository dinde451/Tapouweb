		<h2>HOW TO LEVELING UP YOUR CHARACTER?</h2>
		<p>There are 3 ways to level up your character after having generated it with the CHARACTER BUILDER, but none is perfect.</p>
		
		<div class="icone">
			<i class='fas fa-address-card method'></i>
		</div><div class="texte">
			<h3>Online Character Sheet</h3>
			<p>The first recommended method is to save your Character Sheet on our server. Besides the fact that you can retrieve it from any machine, it is the easiest way to save whenever you want all the modifications related to your character's adventures (expenses, new treasures, etc). The Online Character Sheet also allows you to add details to the features. And if you prefer to write down on paper during the game, you can print the sheet.</p>
					<p>Leveling up in this case is done manually by adjusting the new parameters on the Online Character Sheet.</p>
		</div><div class="icone">
			<i class='fas fa-download method'></i>
		</div><div class="texte">
			<h3>Local File Copy</h3>
			<p>The second method consists of saving your XML character's file on your machine at the end of its creation, then using this file when you want to modify the character's level. This will automatically display the new parameters (new bonus, hit points, new features, etc) and allows you to update the modifications related to your character's adventures (expenses, new treasures, etc) at that moment. But on the other hand, if you have modified the HTML Character Sheet before printing it, to add details to the features for example, they will be lost, and you will have to enter them again each time you level up.
					<p>Leveling up in this case is automatic in terms of character's parameters, but some info might have to be re-entered manually each time on the HTML sheet.</p>
		</div><div class="icone">
			<i class='fas fa-file-alt method'></i>
		</div><div class="texte">
			<h3>Printout or PDF</h3>
			<p>The last method is to print your HTML Character Sheet or to save it in PDF format at the end of its creation, then add in pencil all the subsequent modifications during the game.
					<p>Leveling up in this case is done manually by adjusting the new parameters of the character when you want. You don't need to use the CHARACTER BUILDER anymore, but it can quickly get messy!</p>
